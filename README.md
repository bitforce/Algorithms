# Algorithms

Overview
---
A complete library of personally developed and standard algorithms along with 
explanations of their use-cases, performance-analysis, and code-construction.
Languages used: Java & Python; however, there are expectations to expand 
to: C/C++, Ruby, Go, JavaScript, Shell, Haskell, Ocaml, Perl, X86. The 
idea behind this project being the ability to view via many lenses
how languages evolve, differ, and adapt to best fit their design 
limits and purposes such that they cater to the most fundamental 
and advanced intricacies of logic, with the simplicity of not 
necessarily having to go through cumbersome code docs or 
obscure literature to implement, run, and study.

Usage
---
There are no requirements or dependencies to install, simply go to the aptly 
named directories to search which algorithms you'd like to know about. You 
know you hit the main portion of the algorithm directory when you find a 
README containing information on the algorithm itself, as will as how to 
run it.


Example
---
Assume you'd like to understand and see the original QuickSort algorithm in 
action, and assuming you are in the project folder, you would simply go 
into [./sorting/quick/standard]() and there you will find a README file 
containing information about QuickSort and how to run it in all the 
available languages.
